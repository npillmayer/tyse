/*
Package resources resolves all kinds of resources for an application.

As resource loading may be a time-consuming task, some functions in this
package will work in an async/await fashion by returning a promise.
Functions named

   Resolve…(…)

will return a resource-specific promise type, which the client will call later
to receive the loaded resource. The call to the promise-function will then block
until loading has completed.
