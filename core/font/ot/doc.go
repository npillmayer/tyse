Package ot provides access to OpenType font features.

Status

Work in progress.

License

Some code has originally been copied over from golang.org/x/image/font/sfnt/cmap.go,
as the cmap-routines are not accessible through the sfnt package's API.
I understand this to be legally okay as long as the Go license information
stays intact.
