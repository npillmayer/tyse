/*
Package otshape is work in progress.

From the OpenType spec
(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/chapter2#features-and-lookups):

aOpenType Layout features and lookups define information that is specific to the glyphs in a given font.
They do not encode information that is constant within the conventions of a particular language or the
typography of a particular script. Information that would be replicated across all fonts in a given
language belongs in the text-processing application for that language, not in the fonts.
