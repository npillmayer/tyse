Package khipu is about encoding text into typesetting items.

The Khipukamayuqs (Quechua for “knot-makers”) were the scribes of those
times, tasked with encoding tax figures and other administrative
information in knots.
We will use this analogy to call typesetting items "khipus" or "knots",
and objects which produce khipus will be "Khipukamayuqs".
Knots implement items for typesetting paragraphs. We will use a
box-and-glue model and the various knot
types more or less implement the corresponding node types from the TeX
typesetting system.

A Khipukamayuqs is part of a typsetting pipeline and will transform
text into khipus.
Khipus are the input for linebreakers. The overall process of creating
them and the interaction with line breaking looks like this:

# Create Khipus from Text

1. [ ] Normalize Unicode text

	https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm

1. [ ] Find natural text wrap opportunities
(words in many scripts, syllables/character in East Asia, etc.)

	https://godoc.org/github.com/npillmayer/gotype/gtcore/uax

1. [ ] Bi-directional text

	https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/text/unicode/bidi
	https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/

1. [ ] Hyphenation:
Lliang patterns + language-specific code

	https://godoc.org/github.com/npillmayer/gotype/gtcore/hyphenation

1. [ ] Translate feasible breakpoints to penalties, glue and discretionaries

    https://wiki.apache.org/xmlgraphics-fop/KnuthsModel

1. [ ] Shape text -> Glyphs + alternative glyphs (end-of-line condensed in Arabic, etc.)

At this point, text has been fully converted to khipus.
