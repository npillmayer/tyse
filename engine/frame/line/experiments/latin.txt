CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more
flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable
multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
.css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as
enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages
that share the file and its formatting.
